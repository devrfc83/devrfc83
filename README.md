- 👋 Hi, my name is Rodrigo and I am a neurodivergent human being who works in data science, plays chess and rides motorcycles.
- 🖥️ This account is connected to my Raspberry Pi. I use it to create different projects and to keep myself sharp on UNIX systems.
- 🌱 I am currently learning Python, Node.js, React, Tailwind, and Docker.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on Web, Docker applications, and automation projects.
- 👀 Besides software and electronics, I am interested in travel, languages, music, and photography.
- 💬 I speak Spanish, English, Italian, Portuguese, and German.
- 🎸 I play piano and guitar.
- 📫 You can reach me via my website: https://www.dev-rfc83.com/
- 😄 My pronouns are: he/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I began working in electronics and this Raspberry Pi Zero W because I needed to fix a small toy bought by my sister in New Zealand.
